                <h2>Understanding Dog Bite Laws in Texas</h2>
                <p>If you’re a dog owner in Texas, it’s important to understand the laws surrounding dog bites to ensure that you are complying with legal requirements and that you and your dog are protected in the event of an incident. In Houston, TX, dog owners must adhere to state and local laws regarding dog bites. <br>
                <br>Under Texas law, dog owners are responsible for any damages or injuries caused by their dogs. This means that if your dog bites someone, you may be held liable for any resulting medical expenses, lost wages, or other damages. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as if the person who was bitten provoked the dog or was trespassing on your property. <br>
                <br>In Houston, there are also additional laws regarding dog bites. For example, the city requires that all dogs over four months old be licensed and vaccinated against rabies. If your dog bites someone and it is determined that the dog was not properly vaccinated against rabies, you may face additional fines and penalties. It’s important to take these laws seriously and ensure that your dog is up-to-date on all vaccinations and licenses to avoid any legal issues down the line.  </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Texas Dog Bite Law</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Under Texas law, a dog owner is strictly liable for any injuries caused by their pet if the dog had a previous history of aggressive behavior or if the owner was aware of the dog’s aggressive tendencies. This means that the owner can be held responsible for damages even if they did not know that their dog was capable of biting someone. <br>
                <br>Additionally, Texas law allows for the “negligence” theory of liability. This means that a dog owner can be held responsible for injuries caused by their pet if they were negligent in controlling or restraining the dog. For example, if a dog owner fails to leash their dog in a public area and the dog bites someone, the owner may be held liable for any resulting injuries. <br>
                <br>If you have been bitten by a dog in Texas, it is important to seek medical attention immediately and report the incident to local authorities. You may also want to consider hiring a dog bite attorney to help you navigate through the legal process and ensure that you receive the compensation you deserve.</p>

                <h2>Why You Need a Dog Bite Attorney</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Dogs are considered to be man’s best friend, but they can also be unpredictable and dangerous at times. Dog bites can cause serious injuries that can result in long-term medical treatments and even permanent scarring. If you have been bitten by a dog in Houston, TX, you need to hire a dog bite attorney to help you navigate through the legal process. <br>
                <br>A dog bite attorney can help you determine who is responsible for the attack. In Texas, the law states that the owner of a dog is liable for any injuries caused by their pet. However, there may be other parties involved, such as a landlord who allowed a dangerous dog to reside on their property. An experienced attorney can investigate the incident, gather evidence, and identify all responsible parties to ensure that you receive the compensation you deserve. <br>
                <br><a href="https://oharaattorney.com/why-you-need-a-dog-bite-attorney-understanding-your-legal-rights/" style="color: blue;">Dog bite attorney</a> can help you obtain a fair settlement for your injuries. Dog bite injuries can be severe, resulting in medical bills, lost wages, and emotional trauma. An attorney can help you negotiate with insurance companies to obtain a fair settlement that covers all of your expenses. If a settlement cannot be reached, they can represent you in court and fight for your rights to receive the compensation you deserve.</p>
